# Cables Raw Material Calculater
This code, developed as a sub-module for our organization, serves as a filtering system connected to the main data pipeline. Whenever a new cable inquiry is submitted by our customers, it checks and identifies the cable type, providing the necessary raw materials stored in our database.

I have made some changes in this code so that we can also use separately on our local machines.
